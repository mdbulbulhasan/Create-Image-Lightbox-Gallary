# Create-Image-Lightbox-Gallary

A lightbox gallery is basically used to view the gallery images
in detail specifically. You can code the JavaScript to do so but
also we can use some download the lightbox and attach the JS and
CSS files into our code. For our own design satisfaction, we can
also use the CSS code as we want. We will divide the task into three sections. In the first section, we will create the 
structure in the second section we will add some CSS for our own purpose. In the last section, we will link the download JS and
CSS files.

We have to download the lightbox, we can download that from the
link: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/releases

Creating Structure: In this section, we will code only in HTML
to create a normal HTML gallery.
